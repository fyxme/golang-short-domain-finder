# Requirements

Uses the [whois.go](https://github.com/likexian/whois-go) module.

To install:

`go get -u github.com/likexian/whois-go`


# TODO

- Some domains don't seem to be supported such as gq with current whois server
    - Potential fix: use a list of whois servers such as `https://github.com/whois-server-list/whois-server-list`
